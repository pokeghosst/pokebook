> PokeBook is your own digital notebook for writing poetry. Get into your creative flow with distraction-free environment and never worry about saving what you write!

## What makes PokeBook so cool?

- Workspace split into two independent notepads – jot down notes in one and write the poem in another
- Everything is stored locally – no need to trust anyone to keep your poems nice and safe! Reload the page, close the tab, even reboot your computer, everything will stay there!
- The draft is autosaved with every single character written – don't worry about crashes or blackouts so you can focus on the writing!
- Click "New poem" and you immediately have a clean workspace – previous poem is saved in the Poem Stash™!
- View, edit and delete your previously written poems and store as many as your computer can handle!
- Express yourself with a selection of themes and fonts!
